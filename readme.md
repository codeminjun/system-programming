## Course Overview

This course gently introduces computer systems and systems programming. With the basic knowledge of application-level programming language, we will be getting deeper into a computer system, breaking the programming abstractions.

### Main Topics
- **Software programming and computational problems**
- **The execution engine of a computer**
- **Abstractions that make your text file run on a computing machinery**

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Learn how a computer is organized
- Learn how a computer operates
- Learn what system software is, and how it operates on hardware and software boundary
- Learn what can a computer do/and what not
- Understand computational problems and write simple procedures to resolve them
- Program in MIPS assembly language
